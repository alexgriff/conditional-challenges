# Conditional Challenges

## Color Battle

Write a program that divides a canvas into two different colored rectangles. **Clicking** on one rectangle should increase it's size by a small, set amount, try `10 px`.

When the rectangle that is 'underneath' in the code grows larger, make sure the one 'on top' shrinks accordingly so we can see the growth. There's actually several ways to implement this app!

Ensure that either rectangle cannot have a `height` smaller than `10 px`. Always leave a little to click on so that color can make a comeback!

Can you make this a two-player game-- one player on the mouse, one on the keyboard. What additional features could you add?

(TODO, additional challenges, make something appear/disappear on hover)
